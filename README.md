# QuestLogCollapse

A World of Warcraft addon that automatically collapses the quest log when entering dungeons, raids, or combat situations.
Optionally can filter quests to current zone (triggered by user actions to avoid taint).
**Please Note: This addon does not work with client versions < 10.0**

## Features

- **Automatic Quest Log Management**: Automatically collapses quest log sections when entering instances and expands them when leaving
- **Combat Collapse Support**: Collapses quest trackers during combat outside of instances (with smart queue system)
- **Instance Type Configuration**: Different settings for dungeons, raids, scenarios, battlegrounds, arenas, and combat
- **Individual Section Control**: Fine-grained control over which objective tracker sections to collapse (quests, achievements, bonus objectives, etc.)
- **Character-Specific Profiles**: Settings saved per character with support for multiple profiles
- **GUI Configuration**: Easy-to-use configuration panel accessible via `/qlc config`
- **Combat Queue System**: Smart handling of operations during combat to prevent taint issues
- **Nameplate Integration**: Optional nameplate management for different instance types
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug messages to track addon behavior
- **Manual Control**: Commands to manually collapse/expand configured sections
- **Error-Safe Operation**: Protected against addon taint with comprehensive error handling
- **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact with efficient event handling

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `QuestLogCollapse` folder to your World of Warcraft addons directory:
   - **Windows**: `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\`
   - **macOS**: `Applications/World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/`
3. Restart World of Warcraft or reload your UI (`/reload`)
4. The addon will automatically load and display a confirmation message

## Commands

The addon provides several slash commands for basic control:

- `/qlc` or `/questlogcollapse` - Show help menu with combat behavior information
- `/qlc config` - Open the configuration panel (recommended)
- `/qlc toggle` - Enable/disable the addon
- `/qlc debug` - Toggle debug messages on/off
- `/qlc status` - Show current addon status, combat queue, and section states
- `/qlc collapse` - Manually collapse configured sections (queued during combat)
- `/qlc expand` - Manually expand configured sections (cancels combat queue)
- `/qlc filterzone` - Manually filter quests by current zone (if enabled in settings)
- `/qlc test` - Test objective tracker detection and combat queue status
- `/qlc testcombat` - Test combat settings and tracker availability
- `/qlc help` - Show all available commands

### Combat Behavior

- **Immediate Collapse on Combat Start**: Quest trackers collapse during `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED`, gated by the runtime `TAINT_BLACKLIST` so blacklisted trackers (e.g. Quest, Bonus objectives) are never poked from addon Lua
- **Automatic Expansion**: Quest trackers automatically expand when combat ends (only if they were collapsed during combat)
- **Queue System**: If immediate collapse fails due to taint protection, operations are queued for when combat ends
- **Smart Overrides**: Use `/qlc expand` during combat to cancel any queued collapse operations
- **Instance Priority**: Combat settings are ignored when in dungeons/instances

## Configuration

The addon features a comprehensive configuration panel accessible via `/qlc config`. The panel allows you to:

### Global Settings

- `Enable QuestLogCollapse` (default: true) - Whether the addon is active
- `Filter Quests by Current Zone` (default: false) - Track/Untrack quests in your current zone when you open the map, move, use an ability, mount/dismount, or use `/qlc filterzone`
- `Debug Mode` (default: false) - Whether to show debug messages

### Profile Management

- Create multiple profiles for different characters or situations
- Switch between profiles easily
- Each character can have their own profile settings

### Instance Type Settings

Configure different behaviors for each type of instance:

- **Combat**: Outside instances during combat situations
- **Dungeons**: 5-player group content
- **Raids**: Large group content  
- **Scenarios**: Solo/small group story content
- **Battlegrounds**: PvP battleground content
- **Arenas**: PvP arena content
- **Garrison**: Inside your Garrison
- **Class Hall**: Inside your Legion Class Hall
- **Quest/Map Tables**: When near/using a map/quest/campaign table
- **Neighbourhood**: In your neighbourhood
- **House**: In the interior of your house

### Individual Section Control

For each instance type, you can control which objective tracker sections get collapsed:

- **Quests**: Regular quest objectives
- **Achievements**: Achievement progress tracking
- **Bonus Objectives**: World quest and bonus objectives
- **Scenarios**: Scenario-specific objectives
- **Campaigns**: Campaign quest lines
- **World Quests**: World quest objectives
- **Professions**: Profession recipe tracking
- **Monthly Activities**: Monthly event tracking
- **UI Widgets**: Special UI widget objectives
- **Adventure Maps**: Adventure map objectives

### Additional Options

- **Nameplate Control**: Enable/disable enemy nameplates for each instance type
- **Profile Management**: Create, switch, and manage multiple configuration profiles

## How It Works

The addon uses the World of Warcraft API to:

1. **Detect Zone Changes**: Listens to the `ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA` event
2. **Monitor Combat State**: Tracks `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` and `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` events
3. **Check Instance Type**: Uses `IsInInstance()` to determine if you're in a dungeon, raid, scenario, battleground, or arena
4. **Apply Instance-Specific Settings**: Uses different configurations based on the type of instance you're in
5. **Smart Combat Handling**: Queues operations during combat and applies them safely when combat ends
6. **Manage Individual Sections**: Controls specific ObjectiveTracker modules rather than the entire frame
   - `QuestObjectiveTracker` - Regular quests
   - `AchievementObjectiveTracker` - Achievements  
   - `BonusObjectiveTracker` - World quests and bonus objectives
   - `ScenarioObjectiveTracker` - Scenario objectives
   - `CampaignQuestObjectiveTracker` - Campaign quests
   - `WorldQuestObjectiveTracker` - World quest objectives
   - `ProfessionsRecipeTracker` - Profession recipes
   - `MonthlyActivitiesObjectiveTracker` - Monthly activities
   - `UIWidgetObjectiveTracker` - UI widget objectives
   - `AdventureMapQuestObjectiveTracker` - Adventure map objectives

### Combat Queue System

- **Single Trigger**: Uses `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` to attempt the collapse synchronously
- **Blacklist Gating**: Trackers in the runtime `TAINT_BLACKLIST` are skipped on both collapse and expand to avoid known UIWidget pool taint
- **Smart Expansion**: Tracks which trackers were collapsed during combat and only expands those on combat end
- **State Preservation**: Maintains quest log state when combat collapse is disabled or no trackers were affected
- **Operation Queuing**: If immediate collapse fails (e.g. tracker not yet built), operations are queued and applied when combat ends
- **Manual Overrides**: Allows manual cancellation of queued operations
- **Instance Priority**: Combat operations are ignored when in instances to avoid conflicts

### Events Handled

- `ADDON_LOADED` - Initialize settings when addon loads
- `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` - Mark addon as fully loaded and ready
- `ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA` - Detect when player changes zones/instances (sets flag for zone filtering)
- `PLAYER_STARTED_MOVING` - Triggers pending zone filter when player moves (hardware-initiated)
- `UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED` - Triggers pending zone filter when player casts spells/abilities (hardware-initiated)
- `PLAYER_MOUNT_DISPLAY_CHANGED` - Triggers pending zone filter when mounting/dismounting (hardware-initiated)
- `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` - Handle entering combat (immediate collapse, gated by `TAINT_BLACKLIST`)
- `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` - Handle leaving combat (expand, apply queued operations)

### Zone Filtering Triggers

Zone changes set a "needs filter" flag; the filter runs on the next user-action trigger that picks up the flag:

- **Quest Tracker Interaction** - Triggers when you interact with the objective tracker (minimize/expand)
- **Player Movement** - Triggers when you start moving after a zone change
- **Spell/Ability Use** - Triggers when you cast any spell or ability (including dynamic flight abilities)
- **Mounting/Dismounting** - Triggers when your mount state changes
- **Manual Command** - Use `/qlc filterzone` to trigger anytime

The filter runs synchronously from the trigger event — no `C_Timer.After` deferral.

### Database Structure

- `QuestLogCollapseDB` - Global settings and profiles
- `QuestLogCollapseCharDB` - Character-specific settings (current profile)

## Compatibility

- **WoW Version**: Compatible with retail World of Warcraft (Interface 110002+)
- **Dependencies**: None - this is a standalone addon
- **Conflicts**: Should not conflict with other quest log or UI addons

## Troubleshooting

### Quest Log Not Collapsing/Expanding

1. Check if the addon is enabled: `/qlc status`
2. Open the configuration panel: `/qlc config`
3. Verify that the current instance type is enabled in your active profile
4. Check that the specific sections you want collapsed are enabled for that instance type
5. Enable debug mode to see what's happening: `/qlc debug`
6. Try manually toggling: `/qlc collapse` or `/qlc expand`

### Combat Operations Not Working

1. Check if combat instance type is enabled: `/qlc config`
2. Verify you're outside of instances (combat settings ignored in dungeons/raids)
3. Check combat queue status: `/qlc status`
4. Enable debug mode to see combat queue operations: `/qlc debug`
5. Try manual commands to test: `/qlc collapse` during combat

### Addon Taint Issues

1. The addon uses a combat queue system to prevent taint from collapse operations
2. Zone filtering uses a hybrid trigger system (user actions) to avoid taint from protected quest tracking functions
3. If you see "ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED" errors with zone filtering:
   - The filter requires a user action after zone changes (open map, move, or use `/qlc filterzone`)
   - This is by design to comply with WoW's taint protection system
4. Use `/qlc expand` during combat to cancel problematic queued operations

### Addon Not Loading

1. Ensure files are in the correct directory
2. Check that `QuestLogCollapse.toc` has the correct interface version
3. Make sure all files are present and properly named (`QuestLogCollapse.lua`, `QuestLogCollapse_Config.lua`)
4. Try `/reload` to refresh addons

### Configuration Panel Not Opening

1. Make sure both lua files are loaded properly
2. Check for any lua errors using an error display addon
3. Try `/qlc help` to see if basic commands work

### Settings Not Saving

1. Check that you have write permissions in your WoW directory
2. Verify that `SavedVariables` and `SavedVariablesPerCharacter` are working
3. Settings are saved when you log out or `/reload`

### Debug Information

Enable debug mode with `/qlc debug` to see detailed information about:

- Zone changes and dungeon detection
- Combat state changes and queue operations
- Quest log state changes
- Addon initialization
- Error handling and protected function calls

- Update compatible version

### Version 1.3.1

- **Zone Filtering Taint Fix**: Completely redesigned zone filtering to use hybrid trigger system
  - Zone changes set a flag instead of immediately calling protected functions
  - Filter automatically triggers on user actions (opening map, moving, using abilities, mount/unmount, quest tracker interaction)
  - Added `/qlc filterzone` command for manual triggering
  - Eliminates `ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED` errors from quest tracking operations
  - Now fully compatible with WoW's taint protection system
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README with clear explanation of zone filtering triggers

### Version 1.3

- **Taint Issues Resolved!!!:** Implemented [namespacing](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Using_the_AddOn_namespace) throughout entire addon to resolve secret variable taint issues.
- If this completely resolves taint issues, will remove previous mitigation strategies (disabling collapsing of certain trackers, setting delays etc.) in the next update, but wanted to get this into user's hands asap.
